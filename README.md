This is an example project for Python using GitHub CodeSpaces

[![CI](https://github.com/nogibjj/Sjg80-Mini-Project2/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nogibjj/Sjg80-Mini-Project2/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This Python script uses Pandas to generate descriptive statistics for a dataset (CSV or Excel) and create at least one data visualization.

The script will read the dataset iris.csv and generate the following outputs:

The script will generate a summary of the descriptive statistics for the dataset, including the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for each column. It will also create a histogram of the sepal_length column.

The script will save the summary of the descriptive statistics to a CSV file called summary_statistics.csv and a Markdown file called iris_summary_statistics.md. It will also save the histogram to a PDF file called iris_summary_statistics.pdf.

The script will read the dataset iris.csv and generate the following outputs:
A histogram of the sepal_length column.
A CSV file containing the summary statistics.
A Markdown file containing the summary statistics.
A PDF file containing the summary statistics.

Usage
To use the script, simply replace the iris.csv dataset with your own dataset. You can also change the sepal_length column to any other column in your dataset.
